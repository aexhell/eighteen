Welcome to Aexhell! To be sure you can have a cordial and clear communication with me, you are required to agree to the following points and rules in order to request my services as a developer. Any attempt to contact me for business matters that does not follow these instructions will be ignored.

----
## 1. Project Type
As Aexhell is <ins>not a development team</ins>, any type of offer to carry out a relatively large scale project, see social networks or any type of web/mobile application that requires full-stack knowledge, **will be rejected**. It must be clarified that this does not apply to any type of small project together with a team as a whole. Aexhell may accept project offers as a volunteer.

## 2. Contributions
Aexhell will **not** accept formal job offers where it is required to sign legal agreements. Exceptions are made to offers where only the signing of [NDAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement) is required. Aexhell's contributions will be made through websites using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) contribution system, preferably [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 3. Communications
Communications between Aexhell must be made on English or Spanish, preferably Spanish. Any job offer that requires the use or communication of any other language will be rejected.
For contacting and messaging me, you may use Discord or Polywork.

## 4. Payment
As of now, payments must be made through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/myrebi), [PaySafeCard](https://paysafecard.com/) and, in extremely rare cases, bank transfer. Volunteering projects <ins>may or may not</ins> be free, depending on the project type explained in point one.

## 5. Tech Stack
Depending on the project type, Aexhell accepts web frameworks such as [Nuxt (2/3)](https://nuxt.com/), [Vue](https://vue.js.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) ([Native](https://reactnative.dev/) included) and PHP ([CodeIgniter 4](https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/intro/index.html), depending on the project size). Any other technologies (such as Angular, Svelte, etc.) will be rejected.

## 6. Copyright
Aexhell's names and logo will not appear on your project unless you need or want to add it. Your project will be added to my portfolio as well unless you need to keep it hidden.
