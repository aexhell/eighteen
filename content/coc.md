---

Welcome to Aexhell! To be sure you can have a cordial and clear communication with me, you are required to agree to the following points and rules in order to request my services as a developer. Any attempt to contact me for business matters that does not follow these instructions will be ignored.

----
## 1. Project Type
As Aexhell is <ins>not a development team</ins>, any type of offer to carry out a relatively large scale project, see social networks or any type of web/mobile application that requires full-stack knowledge, **will be rejected**. It must be clarified that this does not apply to any type of small project together with a team as a whole. Aexhell may accept project offers as a volunteer.

## 2. Contributions
Aexhell will **not** accept formal job offers where it is required to sign legal agreements. Exceptions are made to offers where only the signing of [NDAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement) is required. Aexhell contributions must be made through the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) system, preferably [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 3. Language
Communications between Aexhell must be made on English or Spanish, preferably Spanish. Any job offer that requires the use or communication of any other language will be rejected.

## 4. Payment
As of now, payments must be made through PayPal, PaySafeCard and, in extremely rare cases, bank transfer. As specified in point one, volunteer projects are free.

## 5. Tech Stack
Depending on the project type, Aexhell accepts web frameworks such as [Nuxt (2/3)](https://nuxt.com/), [Vue](https://vue.js.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) ([Native](https://reactnative.dev/) included) and PHP ([CodeIgniter 4](https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/intro/index.html), depending on the project size). Any other technologies (such as Angular, Svelte, etc.) will be rejected.
