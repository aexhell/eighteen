I've returned to the IRC project format. This beauty was made on a [Discord](https://discord.com) outage, so the idea of a new IRC came up between me and my friends.
My ideas for this IRC is to make the user control every (or at least, most) of the client's appearance.

For now (and as usual) I'm the only lead developer, with my friends as beta testers. I'm not accepting account register anytime soon.
