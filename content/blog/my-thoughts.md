I started working as a front-end developer in a relatively medium-sized company in Madrid at the age of 16. As young as I started professionally, I have learned more during my work, apart from personal research and passion that I have maintained. What I am going to share is merely advice. It is up to you to want to use them as you need them.

## Keep it simple. But elegant
Remember, not everyone likes simple design, but nowadays we are plagued with such designs. Although, we all like elegant designs. So if you want to reach the greatest number of people and maintain an attractive appearance on your website, you better keep a simple but elegant design.

## Don't forget the content
When I started web design, I did everything extremely detailed, without really having content to show. What's the point of making great designs if the web is completely empty? Give more priority to the content that your visitors are going to see, because they want to see that, content, not design. That doesn't mean you have to entirely downplay design though.

## Good design is hard to notice
Just like in video games, when sound directors do their job well, they are almost invisible, as if they did not exist. Their job is to project a world beyond, but when they do it well, no one has any complaints. The same thing happens with web designers. When a website has a good design, it is not something that jumps out at first, because as I mentioned in point two, visitors come to see content. So keep the aesthetic of your design something complementary to the content.

## Design styles
The vast majority of websites maintain a common aesthetic so that the design doesn't feel so alien to visitors, which is fine. Of course, that doesn't mean that all web designs are the same. If you want to make a design, if you are inspired, try to do it on your own, don't rely on anything else. If you're not inspired, you can always search for ideas on the internet, but in the end, you have to design it.

## Your brand
In the designs you make, they should always have your brand, something that indicates that you made it. For example, I always use my logo in every design I make. Having a brand makes it easy to recognize yourself.
